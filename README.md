# Samaaye Interactive Bot

## Description

Samaaye Interactive Bot is a simple chatbot application built using Python's `tkinter` library. This chatbot is designed to provide responses to questions related to a fictional university's services, such as library hours, coffee bar timings, admission information, and available courses. The bot randomly generates an agent name and responds to user queries accordingly.

The application provides a GUI where users can ask questions, and the chatbot will respond based on predefined keywords. If no matching keyword is found, the chatbot will provide a generic response. The chatbot continues to interact with the user until the user types "bye", "quit", or "exit" to end the conversation.

## Features

- Responses based on specific keywords such as `coffee`, `library`, `admission`, and `courses`.
- Default random responses for unrecognized queries.
